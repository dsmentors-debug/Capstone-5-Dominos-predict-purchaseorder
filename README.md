**Problem Statement**
**Objective: Dominos wants to optimize the process of ordering ingredients by predicting future sales and creating a purchase order. By accurately forecasting sales, Dominos can ensure that it has the right amount of ingredients in stock, minimizing waste and preventing stockouts. This project aims to leverage historical sales data and ingredient information to develop a predictive model and generate an efficient purchase order system.

***Data Preprocessing and Exploration****

**- ****Data Cleaning*** **

    Remove any missing or inconsistent data entries, handle outliers, and format the data appropriately.

**- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)***

-    Analyze sales trends, seasonality, and patterns in the historical sales data. Visualize the data to identify significant features.
